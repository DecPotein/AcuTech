                <h3> What is ACS? </h3>
                <p> ACS is a classification model that aims to classify various types of acute coughs with convinience in mind! </p>
                <p> When visiting hospitals, you often wait in line before you get an audience with a doctor. With ACS, you can get the results in just a matter of seconds! </p>
                <p> It's far from perfect, but we plan to improve it more! </p>
                <p> Currently, the software only classifies four types of acute coughs, these are: </p>
                    <h1> <li> Bronchitis </li> </h1>
                    <h1> <li> The Common Cold </li> </h1>
                    <h1> <li> Pertussis or Whooping Cough </li> </h1>
                    <h1> <li> Pneumonia </li> </h1>
                <p> It also knows when you are healthy and just trying to cough! </p>
